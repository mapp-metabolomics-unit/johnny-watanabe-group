  abstract = {Sucrose esters or sucrose fatty acid esters are a group of non-naturally occurring surfactants chemically synthesized from the esterification of sucrose and fatty acids (or glycerides). This group of substances is remarkable for the wide range of hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) that it covers. The polar sucrose moiety serves as a hydrophilic end of the molecule, while the long fatty acid chain serves as a lipophilic end of the molecule. Due to this amphipathic property, sucrose esters act as emulsifiers; i.e., they have the ability to bind both water and oil simultaneously. Depending on the HLB value, some can be used as water-in-oil emulsifiers, and some as oil-in-water emulsifiers. Sucrose esters are used in cosmetics, food preservatives, food additives, and other products. A class of sucrose esters with highly substituted hydroxyl groups, olestra, is also used as a fat replacer in food.},

  abstract = {Contemporary bioinformatic and chemoinformatic capabilities hold promise to reshape knowledge management, analysis and interpretation of data in natural products research. Currently, reliance on a disparate set of non-standardized, insular, and specialized databases presents a series of challenges for data access, both within the discipline and for integration and interoperability between related fields. The fundamental elements of exchange are referenced structure-organism pairs that establish relationships between distinct molecular structures and the living organisms from which they were identified. Consolidating and sharing such information via an open platform has strong transformative potential for natural products research and beyond. This is the ultimate goal of the newly established LOTUS initiative, which has now completed the first steps toward the harmonization, curation, validation and open dissemination of 750,000+ referenced structure-organism pairs. LOTUS data is hosted on Wikidata and regularly mirrored on https://lotus.naturalproducts.net. Data sharing within the Wikidata framework broadens data access and interoperability, opening new possibilities for community curation and evolving publication models. Furthermore, embedding LOTUS data into the vast Wikidata knowledge graph will facilitate new biological and chemical insights. The LOTUS initiative represents an important advancement in the design and deployment of a comprehensive and collaborative natural products knowledge base.},

  abstract = {An automated LC-MS/MS assay was validated to quantitate the first selective aldosterone blocker Eplerenone (I) and its hydrolyzed metabolite (II) in human urine. After the addition of the stable isotope labeled internal standards, human urine samples were extracted on a C18 solid phase extraction (SPE) cartridge using a Zymark RapidTrace\texttrademark{} automation system. The extraction eluates were diluted with 20 mM ammonium acetate aqueous solution and directly injected onto the LC-MS/MS system. The chromatographic separation was performed on a reverse phase Zorbax XDB-C8 HPLC column (2.1\texttimes 50 mm, 5 {$\mu$}m) with a mobile phase of acetonitrile:water (40:60, v/v) containing 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 7.4). I and II were ionized using positive and negative ionization mass spectrometry, respectively, to achieve the best sensitivity. The ionization polarity was switched during the run at approximately 2.5 min after the injection. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) with a tandem mass spectrometer was used to detect the analytes. The precursor to product ion transitions of m/z 415\textrightarrow 163 and m/z 431\textrightarrow 337 were used to measure I and II, respectively. The assay exhibited a linear dynamic range of 50\textendash 10\hphantom{,}000 ng/ml of urine for both of I and II. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 50 ng/ml for I and II. Acceptable precision and accuracy were obtained for concentrations over the standard curve range. Sample analysis time for each injection was 5 min; a throughput of 100 human urine standards and samples per run was achieved.},

  abstract = {A reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with evaporative light scattering detection is described for the analysis of commercial sucrose esters. The binary gradient consists initially of 75\% methanol and 25\% water. After 70 min, the ratio is changed to 95\% methanol and 5\% water. The gradient is then reverted back to the initial ratio after 120 min for another injection. This procedure provides a complete separation of monoesters and diesters with different acyl chain lengths (C16 and C18). The monoester analyzed was resolved into 3\textendash 6 peaks and diesters into 14\textendash 18 peaks. The identities of monoesters with various acyl chain lengths were further established by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS). This HPLC procedure has several advantages over other reported methods in terms of improved resolution and simultaneous separation of mono- and diesters. With this method it is, thus, possible to determine the approximate composition of mono- and diester of sucrose esters in one analysis.},
